a modle for diagnosis "breast cancer" which all common Data sciences and machine learning pipeline 


the best estimator when using the `all features` is **SVC(C=0.08, gamma=1000, kernel='linear')** with score **98%** <br> 
the best estimator when using `PCA` with 4 components is **KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=11)** with score **95%**


so with this practice, we can figure out which after dimensionality reduction, the model accuracy becomes lower.
